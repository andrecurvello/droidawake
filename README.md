DroidAwake
===========

This widget app keeps your Android device awake when you want it to. Perfect for developers so you don't have to unlock the device from time to time.

It's available on the Android Market for free: [Droid Awake][1]


Feel free to fork, create issues, [buy me a beer][2] or just having fun burning your battery ;-)

If you fork it, feel free to send me pull requests for your awesome new features or bug fixes so they'll make it on the market.
